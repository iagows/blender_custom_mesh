# Blender Custom Mesh

I created this to make it easier to me to add custom meshes I created.

## Why

I don't know how to use Blender. I want to create some assets and easily import into my projects the most used ones.

### The code is ugly

I don't care. Probably I'll never touch it again, only to add menus and files.

## How to use

1. Find "blender_menus".
    1. Label is for the menu label
    1. base path is the folder that contains the files
    1. blender_files
        1. label is for the item label
        1. file_name is the file name

## Issues or suggestions?

Ping me on github.
